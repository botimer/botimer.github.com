          <h1><a href="/posts/2010/11/04/thoughts-on-sakai-oae">Thoughts on “Sakai OAE”</a></h1>
          <p class="meta">November  4, 2010</p>
            <p>If you haven&#8217;t heard, there has been some rebranding effort in the Sakai community recently. The project formerly known as &#8220;Sakai 3&#8221; has been <a href='http://sakaiproject.org/news/sakai-open-academic-environment-confirmed-official-sakai-foundation-project'>dubbed</a> the <em>Sakai Open Academic Environment</em> (OAE). The reaction has been varied; some wonder why a name change at all, some don&#8217;t especially care for the choice, some wonder why it wasn&#8217;t chosen differently&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing this post to give my perspective of why this is a healthy community move, even if the exact name &#8220;OAE&#8221; doesn&#8217;t stick.</p>

<p>This is just one more recognition that we&#8217;re talking about a new and different product. &#8220;3&#8221; doesn&#8217;t work very well as a product identifier, amongst ourselves, or to the broader world. This is an important distinction between Sakai (the community/brand/make) and Sakai (the software/product/model).</p>

<p>As the project portfolio for the Sakai community expands, we need real names for the projects. This looks to become more natural if we draw closer to our <a href='http://www.jasig.org/'>Jasig</a> friends, who already have a number of named projects. (As a side note, be ready to have discussions on your campus and at conferences of how a Collaboration and Learning Environment [CLE] is different from the OAE.)</p>

<p>So, my takeaway, whether you like the name Open Academic Environment or not, is that this is an important step on the maturity path for our community. -NB</p>

<p><em>P.S. Although OAE doesn&#8217;t roll off my tongue very well, I&#8217;m glad to be done with this dance: well, take the S off, and change it to a three. Yeah, it&#8217;s a nerdy thing. No, I didn&#8217;t pick it. They usually pronounce it&#8230; Explaining it always felt like watching awful karaoke.</em></p>

          <p class="meta">March 16, 2010</p>
            <p>It seems that at least a couple of people read my <a href='/posts/2010/03/13/sakai-futures'>last editorial</a>. I didn&#8217;t expect to write a part 2, at least not here or now. But it&#8217;s worth a bit of clarification&#8230;</p>

<p><em>See the very end for the &#8220;bit&#8221; part&#8230;</em></p>

<p>The Sakai Product Manager, Clay Fenlason, has <a href='http://sakaiproject.org/blogs/khomotso/debates-about-community-process'>posted some notes</a> on this ongoing discussion. He rightly points out that it is evolving and happening in large part on the &#8220;management list&#8221;, and that you should join up or watch the archives if interested.</p>

<p>The purpose of this post is to clarify what looks to be a basic disconnect on my opinion, since I was cited and don&#8217;t mean what it looks like Clay heard. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But again our first practical example risks a misunderstanding - that the full process is only really about Sakai 3. There are even some knowledgeable community leaders that are <a href='http://www.dr-chuck.com/csev-blog/000709.html'>coming to this conclusion</a> and <a href='/posts/2010/03/13/sakai-futures'>holding it forth</a> as an insight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that Clay has drawn an interpretation from my communications where I would attribute the process primarily, or even exclusively, to 3.x, thereby grandfathering 2.x into some who-knows-what process. If he read it this way, it is fair to say that others might, too.</p>

<p>I feel <em>quite the opposite</em>, in fact.</p>

            <p>Something has been gnawing at me. Here is my initial assessment:</p>

<p>There are some gradual but quite significant changes coming to how the Sakai community works and releases software, and these changes are quite unclear.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think this is controversial or surprising. I do think that there are lots of ideas, fears, and desires for how this might work out. We are definitely having organizational growing pains.</p>

<p>Here is what I see as already present:</p>

<ul>
<li>Two new groups: the Product Council and Maintenance Team</li>

<li>Release Management emerging as possibly distinct from QA</li>

<li>A relatively new and evolving Product Manager role</li>

<li>Two streams of software (2.x and 3.x)</li>

<li>Tension about how each of these roles shapes either stream</li>
</ul>

<p>Where I&#8217;m going with this is that three of us on the PC share a homework item of looking at what would be helpful support of our Incubation and Product Development phases. However, I have been confounded about the very essence of this assignment given the above list. See the email below for specifics &#8211; it also frames this post as a written reflection.</p>

<p>So, let me reflect.</p>

            <p>Dirt and grass are beautiful. Rocks, twigs, and bugs, too. Sometimes this world recognizes only majestic cathedrals, all too happy to look past the essence of life.</p>

<p>This is a corollary to something I&#8217;ve been struggling to articulate lately. Open source has made it; and because it has made it, people want to make it big. This is fine. I don&#8217;t have a problem with big companies, big projects, big money, and the rest.</p>

<p>Where I get uneasy is when people cultivate the sense that the fundamental distinction of free software is just access to source code, or the even simpler view of having no licensing cost.</p>

<p>No, this isn&#8217;t what really gets me.</p>

          <p class="meta">August  6, 2009</p>
            <p>A handy little snippet&#8230; This is something I&#8217;ve used a few times when I&#8217;m hacking in a working copy and need to change POMs for some local reason (usually versioning) but can&#8217;t check them back in modified. I&#8217;d like to tweak the POMs, work on other stuff, build/test, check everything <em>but</em> the POMs in, rinse and repeat. Here&#8217;s a workaround:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='nv'>$ </span>svn st | grep <span class='s1'>&#39;^M&#39;</span> | grep <span class='o'>[</span> <span class='se'>\/</span><span class='o'>]</span>pom.xml<span class='s1'>&#39; | sed &#39;</span>s/^.......//<span class='s1'>&#39; | \</span>
<span class='s1'>  xargs -I{} svn diff {} &gt; pom.patch</span>
<span class='s1'>$ svn st | grep &#39;</span>^M<span class='s1'>&#39; | grep [ \/]pom.xml&#39;</span> | sed <span class='s1'>&#39;s/^.......//&#39;</span> | <span class='se'>\</span>
  xargs -I<span class='o'>{}</span> svn revert <span class='o'>{}</span>
<span class='nv'>$ </span>svn ci -m <span class='s1'>&#39;whatever&#39;</span>
<span class='nv'>$ </span>patch -p0 &lt; pom.patch
</code></pre>

<p>Happy hacking. -NB</p>

          <h1><a href="/posts/2009/08/04/graceful-ajax-degradation-progressive-enhancement">Graceful AJAX degradation / progressive enhancement</a></h1>
          <p class="meta">August  4, 2009</p>
            <p>In one of those beautifully lucky moments, I found an article I was wishing I had kept track of last night. I was chatting with Chuck and Matt a week ago about the pervasion of script in web pages these days and how hardly anything degrades reasonably. For years, I refused script entirely but, now, I have fallen victim to the trend. &#8220;Everybody has script enabled anyway. Mashups are inevitable. They want AJAX. Just script it.&#8221; That doesn&#8217;t mean that I don&#8217;t still want to use <a href='http://elinks.or.cz/'>ELinks</a> deep down.</p>

<p>So, I read one of those articles a while back where you feel a little bump and realize someone has lighted the path &#8211; with the best kind of light, showing the unnoticed obviousness. It&#8217;s like observing that HTTP actually works pretty well when you use it as carefully built, ten years after working around it furiously. It&#8217;s like noticing that really ugly <em>(well structured, unstyled)</em> web pages take the most beautiful CSS easily.</p>

<p>But I lost the article. And my recollection didn&#8217;t do it justice or support the point that you can script the snot out of a page without breaking Lynx. Then I read the Thread on Safari support in Sakai, mentioning <a href='http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/'>Yahoo! Graded Browser Support</a>. And something snapped; I thought this may have been where I found the article&#8230;</p>

<p>The article was on <strong><a href='http://domscripting.com/blog/display/41'><em>Hijax</em></a></strong>.</p>

<p>This is a cute name Jeremy Keith came up with for an approach to adding AJAX magic without breaking the basic function of web pages. It&#8217;s more or less a philosophical first principle of modern web development. You should read this article daily and soak it in like the <a href='http://www.canonical.org/~kragen/tao-of-programming.html'>Tao</a>. -NB</p>

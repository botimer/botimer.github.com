    <p>Nathan Pearson, Sakai&#8217;s lead for the UX Initiative just forwarded a <a href='http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/934-ira-glass-entropy-and-software-development'>post from the 37signals blog</a>. It&#8217;s referencing a video interview with Ira Glass, where he talks about being a fierce editor and moderator, cutting more tape than you roll. The post extends the interview&#8217;s mention of entropy as the disorganizing, enemy force to software.</p>

<p>In principle, I agree: entropy tends to bloat, delay, and complicate software. But the read-only experience of listener/viewer in storytelling is a bit different from daily use software. The post reveals some of the company&#8217;s &#8220;less is <strike>more</strike> all&#8221; philosophy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I give them credit for about half of the simplification and clarity we&#8217;re seeing on the web in general. All told, Rails is pretty nice, and they don&#8217;t get enough credit there. Putting the spoils of the past 5 years of practice evolution in front of the new generation of tinkerers is a very good thing. Specific to their apps, I love that they push products that do something very small, very well.</p>

<p>I believe that being a fierce gatekeeper, <a href='http://c2.com/xp/RefactorMercilessly.html'>refactoring mercilessly</a>, and outright trashing old/bad stuff is paramount to evolution of a system. But I also believe that 37signals has had a little too much Kool-Aid. When you push practice into philosophy and eventually into religion, your inertia can get downright indomitable.</p>

<p>A case in point from their flagship, <a href='http://basecamphq.com/'>Basecamp</a>&#8230;</p>

<p>On the To-Do dashboard, each member across projects is listed in a drop-down, so you can see outstanding items assigned. Then there is an entry for &#8220;Anyone&#8221;. But it really means &#8220;No One&#8221; &#8211; items able to be picked up, but that no one has. There is no way to see &#8220;Everyone&#8221; (all undone items), so I asked them for it directly.</p>

<p>The response could have come from Cupertino. It&#8217;s good for you like this, eat it and be happy. This was the one feature I really needed, and they wouldn&#8217;t consider it. It was enough to kill the usefulness and curb my enthusiasm, to be sure. I could adopt their version of minimalism or move on with mine intact.</p>

<p>So, in response to Matt&#8217;s post&#8230; Vigilance against miscellany is critical, but it can&#8217;t become a fortress. I think we do well to say &#8220;no&#8221; a couple of times while thinking &#8220;maybe&#8221;. If it keeps coming up, &#8220;maybe&#8221; turns to &#8220;probably&#8221;, and the scale tips. <a href='http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt'>YAGNI</a> is great until someone DOES need it.</p>

<p>That progression depends on being the &#8220;ruthless killer&#8221; without becoming a zealot or a lunatic. We might know better than the user most of the time, but we should never be so arrogant as to assume it always and declare it so without consideration.</p>

<p>In the complex realm where Sakai lives, we should always be careful when giving people &#8220;a better way&#8221;. It&#8217;s possible to deliver obvious clarity about as easily as frustration and obfuscation in something so dear as the ability to educate and learn, all to uphold the &#8220;simple and better&#8221; philosophy. -NB</p>

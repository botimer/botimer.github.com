Sakai/OSP development is expensive, so it's hard to find funding prioritized
for the "soft" benefits of personal ownership and development that might not
jive with the "hard" outcomes understood as necessary for accountability.

I believe these "soft" outcomes can communicate accountability just as well,
and even better, but it's a much more intensive project that needs smart,
creative, dedicated people over time. The consumable accountability data needs
to be assembled as a secondary product, as opposed to the primary, "automatic"
data products of rigid accountability measures. _(...which feel a bit like
TPS reports to student, faculty, and implementors, in my experience.)_

This is one area where the "lower bar" open source systems have an apparent
upper hand in development. Good portions of the development happens by
motivated folks who have some time to give to personalization. It's easy enough
to "get in" that essentially unfunded effort bolsters those aspects.

I believe that, in today's higher education climate, any system that doesn't
address accountability in a systematic fashion will fall out of favor very
quickly at any institution where the words "ePortfolio" and "assessment" have
been uttered in the same sentence. It's really hard to build a realistic
accountability system in your spare time, out of the context of a real
accountability project.

This is where Sakai/OSP is uniquely positioned. We're admittedly a bit behind
on personalization, but that is changing quickly. At the same time, we have a
depth of reach into the "regular" learning system activities and assessment
capacities that's unparalleled. It's also a primary goal for a number of us to
make raw development much easier. I really believe the 2.6 release has the
potential to change the game. -NB

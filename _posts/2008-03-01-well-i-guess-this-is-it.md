I've held out on this blog thing even longer than I did on ICQ (remember that
thing?)...  I guess I've finally broken down.  Three things have inspired me, I
suppose:
	
 1. We're doing some work with the notions of the read-write web (2.0?),
    ePortfolios, and digital authorship, so I guess I should get on board a little.
 2. I need an indexed place to jot thoughts and share them, as we approach a
    six-month development sprint in Sakai/OSP.
 3. I've finally accepted that I will never have a chance to make that
    community knowledge base / code snippet site I've been planning for five years.

So, I guess it's obligatory at this point: First Post!!111

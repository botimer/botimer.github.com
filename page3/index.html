          <p class="meta">March 29, 2008</p>
            <p>Nathan Pearson, Sakai&#8217;s lead for the UX Initiative just forwarded a <a href='http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/934-ira-glass-entropy-and-software-development'>post from the 37signals blog</a>. It&#8217;s referencing a video interview with Ira Glass, where he talks about being a fierce editor and moderator, cutting more tape than you roll. The post extends the interview&#8217;s mention of entropy as the disorganizing, enemy force to software.</p>

<p>In principle, I agree: entropy tends to bloat, delay, and complicate software. But the read-only experience of listener/viewer in storytelling is a bit different from daily use software. The post reveals some of the company&#8217;s &#8220;less is <strike>more</strike> all&#8221; philosophy.</p>

          <p class="meta">March 29, 2008</p>
            <p>Those of you who attended the Sakai conference in Atlanta might recognize that quote. It&#8217;s attributable to <a href='http://www.law.columbia.edu/fac/Eben_Moglen'>Eben Moglen</a> (<a href='http://www.softwarefreedom.org/'>SFLC</a>), uttered during the &#8220;lunch discussion&#8221; with <a href='http://investor.blackboard.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=177018&amp;dc=177018&amp;p=irol-govBio&amp;ID=117644'>Matthew Small</a> (<a href='http://www.blackboard.com/'>Blackboard</a>). &#8220;These are the data,&#8221; is a quote I&#8217;ve used countless times in the past 16 months. I&#8217;ll explain in a moment.</p>

<p>So, fast-forward, and we see posts from <a href='http://www.mfeldstein.com/'>Michael Feldstein</a> on the <a href='http://mfeldstein.com/all-44-blackboard-patent-claims-invalidated-by-uspto/'>initial invalidation of all 44 claims</a> and <a href='http://mfeldstein.com/blackboard-fails-statistics-101/'>Blackboard&#8217;s response</a>. The latter post (and Bb&#8217;s statement) is specifically about the percentages of patents that are upheld, invalidated, or altered under reexamination. This is the exact context of Dr. Moglen&#8217;s original quote. He presented some hard figures and summed up with those ringing words.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not going to beat up on Blackboard &#8211; they&#8217;re looking at the rules and playing the game. I completely disagree with software patents, but they&#8217;re still allowed in the rulebook, so I can&#8217;t blame them for filing before someone else did. Indeed, the applications were filed in 1999 and 2000. It was a different frontier with respect to the Internet, Free Software, and software patents then (see LZW, Unisys, SCO).</p>

<p>Personally, I thought it was pretty bad karma to file a press release of a patent and lawsuit on the same day, turning the red lights in people&#8217;s minds into white hot light on the detailed claims. But then again, I&#8217;m not on their strategy team. It&#8217;s just too bad that we&#8217;re tying up all the energy, time, and tax dollars, bickering over how we play in the same edusandbox and who gets how big a slice.</p>

<p>Anyway, there are 44 patent claims. Of the 10 issues set forth in the reexamination request, the rejections of 6 were adopted with modification, those of one without modification, and those of 3 were not adopted. The union of all adopted rejections deems that all of the claims set forth in United States Patent 6,988,138 are unpatentable. These are the data. -NB</p>

          <h1><a href="/posts/2008/03/17/dojo-storage-a-timely-treat">Dojo Storage — A timely treat</a></h1>
          <p class="meta">March 17, 2008</p>
            <p>Every so often, something goes your way, ya know? So, last Thursday, I posted to sakai-dev asking whether I should use dojox.storage or borrow some stuff from rWiki:</p>

<p><a href='http://www.nabble.com/Flash-storage----dojo.storage-or-homebrew--td16033853.html'>http://www.nabble.com/Flash-storage&#8212;-dojo.storage-or-homebrew&#8211;td16033853.html</a></p>

<p>It also just so happens that the main guy behind dojox.storage, Brad Neuberg, apparently felt like being a kind soul, did a ton of refactoring work, and bundled up the smallest, most practical package possible for my immediate need and posted it, not three hours later:</p>

<p><a href='http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2008/03/easy-download-of-dojo-storage-for.html'>http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2008/03/easy-download-of-dojo-storage-for.html</a></p>

<p>So far, it&#8217;s really easy to use (about 15 total lines, and tastes like HashMap) and moves between browsers very well. I&#8217;m only having one issue on IE. It&#8217;s choking on line 52 of some unnamed file that a little Googling hints is related to the Flash plugin. (For the curious, it&#8217;s an Object Required error in <strong>flash</strong>removeCallback()&#8230;)</p>

<p>I guess this can happen with different ways of including SWF files &#8211; the confusing bit is that one thread says use the HTML embedding, rather than JavaScript, and another says to use JavaScript rather than HTML. The tricky part is that both seemed to fix it.</p>

<p>So, I&#8217;m going to test on a machine that doesn&#8217;t have script debugging turned on and hope for the best. If it doesn&#8217;t grumble too badly, I&#8217;ll poke around for a fix in my spare time.</p>

<p>Either way &#8211; Cheers, Brad! You really made my day. -NB</p>

          <h1><a href="/posts/2008/03/09/personal-artifacts-vs-official-purposes">Personal artifacts vs. official purposes</a></h1>
          <p class="meta">March  9, 2008</p>
            <p>How long should personal artifacts submitted in some official capacity be viewable (by learner or official) in their original state? How we can let learners really own their materials?</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve approached this problem to date by ignoring it. We make an explicit step: at some point, we force to student to say &#8221;I&#8217;m done with this thing and it&#8217;s yours forever&#8221;, and lock it. Or we just let it be malleable forever.</p>

<p>This is directly analogous to how, in logic, math, and computer science, we sometimes restrict input to maintain a lower conceptual threshold. Persistence and security of artifacts is a really hard problem, so we make sure it can&#8217;t destabilize the easier ones we&#8217;re solving, by distilling a complex grey gradient into blacks and whites.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a perfectly valid way to get a foundation, but it&#8217;s time to move into our version of second-order logic &#8211; versioned, purpose-stamped, multi-threaded artifacts &#8211; to address our complex realities. We can&#8217;t lie to ourselves and believe that hard-locking a student&#8217;s file forever is practical in a personal learning experience.</p>

<p>The specific thought that triggered this post was that the notion of estimated secure lifetime in cryptography is relevant to visible/storage lifetime in ePortfolios. However, this post also includes thoughts on the concepts of fluid artifacts being copied and made concrete at submission time, and how this relates to our existing web/email usage patterns.</p>

<p>Lots more below the break.</p>

          <h1><a href="/posts/2008/03/09/sakai-and-osp-development-accountability-personalization">Sakai and OSP — development, accountability, personalization</a></h1>
          <p class="meta">March  9, 2008</p>
            <p>Sakai/OSP development is expensive, so it&#8217;s hard to find funding prioritized for the &#8220;soft&#8221; benefits of personal ownership and development that might not jive with the &#8220;hard&#8221; outcomes understood as necessary for accountability.</p>

<p>I believe these &#8220;soft&#8221; outcomes can communicate accountability just as well, and even better, but it&#8217;s a much more intensive project that needs smart, creative, dedicated people over time. The consumable accountability data needs to be assembled as a secondary product, as opposed to the primary, &#8220;automatic&#8221; data products of rigid accountability measures. <em>(&#8230;which feel a bit like TPS reports to student, faculty, and implementors, in my experience.)</em></p>

<p>This is one area where the &#8220;lower bar&#8221; open source systems have an apparent upper hand in development. Good portions of the development happens by motivated folks who have some time to give to personalization. It&#8217;s easy enough to &#8220;get in&#8221; that essentially unfunded effort bolsters those aspects.</p>

<p>I believe that, in today&#8217;s higher education climate, any system that doesn&#8217;t address accountability in a systematic fashion will fall out of favor very quickly at any institution where the words &#8220;ePortfolio&#8221; and &#8220;assessment&#8221; have been uttered in the same sentence. It&#8217;s really hard to build a realistic accountability system in your spare time, out of the context of a real accountability project.</p>

<p>This is where Sakai/OSP is uniquely positioned. We&#8217;re admittedly a bit behind on personalization, but that is changing quickly. At the same time, we have a depth of reach into the &#8220;regular&#8221; learning system activities and assessment capacities that&#8217;s unparalleled. It&#8217;s also a primary goal for a number of us to make raw development much easier. I really believe the 2.6 release has the potential to change the game. -NB</p>

          <h1><a href="/posts/2008/03/09/eclipse-ganymede-34-still-no-visual-editor">Eclipse Ganymede (3.4) - Still no Visual Editor?</a></h1>
          <p class="meta">March  9, 2008</p>
            <p>About a year ago, I was anxious that an upgrade from the <a href='http://www.eclipse.org/vep/WebContent/main.php'>Visual Editor Project</a> might be included in the Eclipse Europa (3.3) release&#8230;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of the portability, speed, and general native feel of SWT, and I&#8217;m generally a fan of the Eclipse setup. I&#8217;ve also done a good bit of C# stuff for hacking out GUIs for one-off apps. It&#8217;s actually easier than dealing with console scripts and you can hand off an .exe to let someone accomplish something without a proper shell. Given that working with Sakai is pretty Java-intensive, and that I was bouncing between OSX/XP, I figured these lightweight admin-style GUIs could be hacked together in SWT&#8230; Boy, was I wrong.</p>

<p>I admire the complexity of a GUI builder that generates all kinds of layout code, etc. It&#8217;s definitely not something I want to take on as a project right now. But, I&#8217;m pretty frustrated with the VEP. It missed the Europa bundle &#8211; no big deal, I thought &#8211; &#8220;there&#8217;ll be a package soon enough; this is important stuff&#8221;. Along comes October (three full months later), and this is posted on the main page:</p>

<p><img alt='Visual Editor + Europa == ouch' src='/images/2008/03/vep-notice-narrow.png' /></p>

<p>To my knowledge, this is the only official status update from the VEP since. While scraping the blogs and forums, I found one guy who seems to be maintaining unofficial builds, but I don&#8217;t see any active development at all. If you&#8217;re dangerous, you can check out <a href='http://www.ehecht.com/eclipse_ve/ve.html'>http://www.ehecht.com/eclipse_ve/ve.html</a> &#8211; he even has a Ganymede M3-compatible bundle &#8211; I&#8217;m too <del>scared</del> <del>disinterested</del> busy to spend the time.</p>

<p>And now that NetBeans has released 6.0 with cleaned up usability and the actually-funded Matisse, I&#8217;m really starting to wonder if I should give it another look. Another really cool feature I saw demoed was live model diagrams with full round-tripping right in the IDE. And they seem to have a BPEL designer integrated, which tickles my SOA side.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not giving up on Eclipse, but I treat free software kind of like free agency: I use and probably contribute to what works for me. The adoption/switching cost is based on learning/porting time and, for an IDE, I figure that to be about two weekends of hacking to get productive. If I can crank up and save a few hours at a crack by being able to whip up a GUI and evolve a new data model with autodiagrams, it&#8217;s pretty tempting. -NB</p>
